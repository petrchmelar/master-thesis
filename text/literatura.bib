  abstract = { During the past two decades, digital radiography has supplanted screen-film radiography in many radiology departments. Today, manufacturers provide a variety of digital imaging solutions based on various detector and readout technologies. Digital detectors allow implementation of a fully digital picture archiving and communication system, in which images are stored digitally and are available anytime. Image distribution in hospitals can now be achieved electronically by means of web-based technology with no risk of losing images. Other advantages of digital radiography include higher patient throughput, increased dose efficiency, and the greater dynamic range of digital detectors with possible reduction of radiation exposure to the patient. The future of radiography will be digital, and it behooves radiologists to be familiar with the technical principles, image quality criteria, and radiation exposure issues associated with the various digital radiography systems that are currently available. © RSNA, 2007 },

  abstract  = {Tone mapping and visual adaptation are crucial for the generation of static, photorealistic images. A largely unexplored problem is the simulation of adaptation and its changes over time on the visual appearance of a scene. These changes are important in interactive applications, including walkthroughs or games, where effects such as dazzling, slow dark-adaptation, or more subtle effects of visual adaptation can greatly enhance the immersive impression. In applications such as driving simulators, these changes must be modeled in order to reproduce the visibility conditions of real-world situations. In this paper, we address the practical issues of interactive tone mapping and propose a simple model of visual adaptation. We describe a multi-pass interactive rendering method that computes the average luminance in a first pass and renders the scene with a tone mapping operator in the second pass. We also propose several extensions to the tone mapping operator of Ferwerda et al. [FPSG96]. We demonstrate our model for the display of global illumination solutions and for interactive walkthroughs.},
